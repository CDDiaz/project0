## Game Start

Tic Tac Toe comes with two main game modes: Quick game and Custom Game.
The button selectors for the modes are close to the top of the page for easy access.

### Quick Game

Quick games do not require any additional information from the players to play the game. The game will use standard "X" and "O" for player one and two, respectively.

To start a quick game, simply click the button and start playing.

### Custom Game

Custom games give the players the option to specify their nickname and their chosen character identifier to play the game. The game will be personalised and their information will be used during the game for record keeping.

To start a custom game, both players should first fill the player information section and then click "Start a Custom Game". A custom game will start and their information will be saved for future games.

To start a new round and preserve the player information, click the "Start a Quick Game" button, a new round will start for the same players.

## Players Information

The section is divided in two parts, one for each player. Each part contains the fields for the players to input their information.

A visual cue will alert the player when it's their turn, by turning the "Your Turn" message to green. Equally, the other player will be shown a red colour message instead.

## Game

Standard tic tac toe game, where a player wins if they get three square spaces in a line, in any direction. A draw or tie happens when no player wins.

Each player clicks their desired square space if it's empty, and the game will register their move.

## Match History

This section will show the record of games played, as well as games won by each player and draws.

## *Dark / Light Themes*

The page can be displayed with a dark or a light theme, by clicking the links at the top right corner of the page.
